excerpt: 'With continuous deterioration of the natural environment and the corresponding significant increase in the occurrence of
disasters, forest fire accidents have frequently occurred in recent decades. Therefore, it is important to perform extensive
effective fire drills to increase evacuation experience and emergency reaction capacity. In comparison to traditional fire
drills, which are subject to many latent uncertainties and incur high costs, fire exercises based on virtual scenarios offer
many advantages, such as low cost and high safety. Accordingly, the planning and design of effective evacuation paths that
sufficiently match real conditions have become an imperative focus of related research. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework for path planning in virtual emergency scenarios, which consists of three parts. (a) Configuration of the virtual
environment: for convenience in handling, the virtual emergency scenario is discretized into many individual grid cells. (b)
Policy generation: a dual deep Q-learning network approach is employed to obtain an effective policy that can allow agents
to intelligently find effective paths. (c) Grouping strategy: a strategy is proposed to support multiple agents in achieving
collective evacuation based on a given policy. Finally, extensive experiments are presented to validate the superiority of the
proposed framework. The results show that by comparison with the existing related state-of-the-art methods, our proposed
framework is superior and feasible'
