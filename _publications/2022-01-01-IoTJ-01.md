permalink: /publication/2022-01-01-IoTJ-01
excerpt: 'With the increasing importance of data security, privacy protection has gradually risen to a strategic position,
especially IoT data privacy protection. The concern for data security has become a national strategy. The discovery of potential
risks of privacy data is of great significance, such as the risk of data privacy leakage, data security vulnerabilities, etc. In this
article, starting from the privacy data protection mechanism in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario, we proposed
a method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to discover the privacy data security risks in IIoT by
training privacy protection agents using a large amount of expert data on privacy protection. Finally, our proposed method is validated by relevant simulation experiments, and the results show that our proposed method has wide generalizability and reliability to obtain the maximum payoff of the agents and thus, reduce the risk of data security leakage'
