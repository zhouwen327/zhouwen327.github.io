excerpt: 'With the rapid development of Web3D, virtual reality, and digital twins, virtual trajectories and decision data considerably rely on the analysis and understanding of real video data, particularly in emergency evacuation scenarios. Correctly and effectively evacuating crowds in virtual emergency scenarios are becoming increasingly urgent. One good solution is to extract pedestrian trajectories from videos of emergency situations using a multi-target tracking algorithm and use them to define evacuation procedures.'

To implement this solution, a trajectory extraction and optimization framework based on multi-target tracking is developed in this
study. First, a multi-target tracking algorithm is used to extract and preprocess the trajectory data of the crowd in a video. Then, the trajectory is optimized by combining the trajectory point extraction algorithm and the Savitzkyâ€“Golay smoothing filtering method. Finally, related experiments are conducted, and the results show that the proposed approach can effectively and accurately extract the trajectories of multiple target objects in real-time. In addition, the proposed approach retains the real characteristics of the trajectories as much as possible while improving the trajectory smoothing index, which can provide data support for the analysis of pedestrian trajectory data and formulation of personnel evacuation schemes in emergency scenarios. Further comparisons with methods used in related studies confirm the feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework
